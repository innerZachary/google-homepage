The goal is to remake the Google homepage and push it to Github. 

So it only took me about 4 hours (LOL) but it sort of looks like a Google homepage.
I think I would like to come back to this in the future to tinker and make it more of a responsive/real design.

Some items are forced in position, and maybe more time could be spent on the nav bar and footer.

I'm definitely having issues that I don't fully understand making the heigh of certain elements fit correctly

It might be worth experimenting with height: 100% vs height 100vh?
